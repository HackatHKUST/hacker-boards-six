MHacks Six Hacker Boards
============
This repository contains the support files for the MHacks 6 Hacker Boards, presented at the Intro to Hardware Workshop ([presentation can be found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15O3TXqOf3Xi9S6ba83HRF5j0ccdkGcIPRQTYAptkbrs/edit#slide=id.gdf724c5d4_0_47)). In the hardware folder is copies of the Eagle schematic and board layout for the board given to participants, and in the firmware folder is the library to simplify working with the board's LEDs, button, and potentiometer/knob - also called "peripherals".
